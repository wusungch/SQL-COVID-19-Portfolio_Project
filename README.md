# SQL-Portfolio-Project

## Project Description:
* Created and managed two relational database tables, covidvaccinations and coviddeaths, to store COVID-19 related data.
* Loaded real-world COVID-19 data from CSV files into the database using the LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE command.
* Conducted comprehensive data analysis, employing SQL queries to calculate key COVID-19 statistics, such as total cases, total deaths, death percentages, and infection rates.
* Utilized statistical techniques to derive insights from the data, including trend analysis and pattern identification.
* Implemented Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create intermediate tables, facilitating complex data operations.
* Integrated data from multiple sources by joining and merging datasets from the coviddeaths and covidvaccinations tables to provide a holistic view of the COVID-19 situation.
* Presented data effectively using SQL queries to generate tables and summary statistics.
* Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by identifying countries with high infection rates and calculating death rates.

## Key Skills and Techniques Highlighted:
* Database Management
* Data Cleaning and Transformation
* Data Analysis and Visualization
* Statistical Analysis
* Common Table Expression (CTE) Usage
